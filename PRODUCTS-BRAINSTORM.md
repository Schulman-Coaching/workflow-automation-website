# Product 1: InboxPilot
## "Your AI Email Assistant"

### The Problem
- Average professional spends **28% of their workday** on email
- Important emails get buried under newsletters and noise
- Follow-ups slip through the cracks
- Writing the same responses over and over

- **VIP detection** — Learns who matters most (clients, boss, key partners)
- **Daily digest** — Morning summary of what needs attention today
