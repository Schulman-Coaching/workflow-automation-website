# Workflow Automation Portfolio Website
## Brainstorming & Design Concepts

---

## 1. Strategic Foundation

### Target Audience: SMBs
- **Who they are**: Business owners, operations managers, team leads at companies with 10-500 employees
- **Pain points**: Manual processes eating up time, siloed tools, scaling challenges, limited IT resources
- **Decision drivers**: ROI clarity, ease of implementation, reliable support, proven results

### Goals Balance
| Goal | Priority | Key Metrics |
|------|----------|-------------|
| Lead Generation | High | Form submissions, demo requests, email signups |
| Product Showcase | High | Time on product pages, feature engagement |
| Educational Hub | Medium | Blog traffic, resource downloads, return visits |

## 3. Design Direction: Professional & Corporate

### Visual Identity Concepts

**Option A: "Trusted Partner"**
- Navy blue (#1e3a5f) + slate gray + white
- Subtle geometric patterns
- Photography: diverse business settings, real people
- Typography: clean sans-serif (Inter, Source Sans Pro)

**Option B: "Modern Enterprise"**
- Deep purple (#4a1d96) + cool gray + accent gold
- Abstract flowing lines (suggesting workflow)
- Illustrations: isometric diagrams, process flows
- Typography: geometric sans (Outfit, Manrope)

**Option C: "Approachable Professional"**
- Teal (#0d9488) + warm gray + cream accents
- Rounded corners, softer shadows
- Mixed: photography with subtle illustrations
- Typography: friendly but professional (Plus Jakarta Sans)

### Design Principles
1. **Clarity over cleverness** — SMBs want to understand quickly
2. **Show, don't just tell** — demos, screenshots, animations
3. **Trust signals everywhere** — logos, testimonials, security badges
4. **Mobile-first** — many SMB owners research on phones
